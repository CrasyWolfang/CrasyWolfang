<h2>Background</h2>

<p>A cat story is a one minute long stop-motion video.
The story is about a cat who went to the market everyday to buy fish.
Then one day it receives a fishing rod instead of a fish and it tries its luck in fishing.</p>

<p>The video was made as an college assignment.
The assignment was to try to make a stop-motion video in a week.</p>

<h2>Style</h2>

<p>Simple characters were drawn on post-it notes.
To animate expressions, different facial expressions were also drawn.
In order to portray some feeling of life every cut was taken with either 2 or 4 photos.</p>

<p>The script did not only include stop-motion but also contained live action.
The live action added context to the stop-motion, and without loosing the sense life the frame-rate could be lowered.</p>

<h2>Process</h2>

<p>The process for the video was unusual.
When it was time to meet with the actors the script was still unfinished.
From there the script was written together with the actors.</p>
