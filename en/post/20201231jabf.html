<p>"Japanese Baby Food" is a informative video made for Osaka International House Foundation.
The content of the video circulates around baby food.
For example, how to make rice gruel.</p>

<p>Because the video is aimed for foreigners that have immigrated to Japan, it is named "Japanese Baby Food."
However, since the ingredients shown are grow in various countries across the world, the baby food is not exceptional for Japan.</p>

<p>The video was made in August within the month and released in November.
Unfortunately, due to other circumstances, there was not enough time for high quality video.
Therefore animations were cut short and video as well as photo captures were rushed.
Consequently almost all captures were taken during one single night.</p>

<h2>Style</h2>

<p>For the video a class room Power Point style was chosen.
This was because of the slow pacing which fit the video content.
It's probably the most sluggish style for video content possible, however it easily allows for lists and tables to be displayed.</p>

<p>Besides lists and charts, recorded video was also used.
The recorded parts was were about rice gruel.
Because there uncertainty might arise from the viewer if only pictures and descriptions are used, the recipe for rice gruel was explained with recorded video.</p>

<h2>Animation and captures</h2>

<p>Two animations were made.
One animation of a hedgehog and one of a crawling baby.
Because of the surrounding conditions, a third animation of a turtle eating lettuce was cut out of production.</p>

The animations used. A hedgehog (left) and a crawling baby (right).

<p>The animations were made out of 4 frames each.
Both of them were drawn on paper and then digitized via photography.
The hedgehog was drawn without legs.
These were later added on a computer and a back and forward motion was added.
In order to portray realistic movements, the second animation  was drawn from a YouTube video of a 6 and a half year old baby.</p>

A YouTube video called "A Baby that likes the guitar? 6 and a half month." The baby was drawn from this video.

<p>The background for the video composed of close-up shots of various fruits.
This experimental approach was to break away from usual plain backgrounds.
A problem that occurred was that text would become difficult to read depending on placement.
Maybe if a simple drawing surrounding the frame would had been used instead of such a background, the results might had been just as interesting.</p>

Example of a simple frame to the background

<h2>Audio</h2>

<p>The audio for the video consisted of narration, sound effects and background music.
All of it was taken with a audio recorder.
Because of the surrounding circumstances there were some problems even here.
First of all, the narration was recorded in a room where an air conditioner was turned on which led to a dry throat which in turns made it difficult to pronounce the lines properly.
Furthermore, corrected lines were recorded in another room which had different acoustics.
For future videos a small studio has been created where high quality audio is possible.</p>

<p>Since there was only one sound effect it was quickly recorded.
The music was recorded last to match the video.
The melody was made on the spot which is why it is uneven in some places.</p>

<h2>Subtitles and tables</h2>

<p>Besides Japanese subtitles together with English, a version of the video with Chinese and Vietnamese, Korean and Filipino subtitles were also made.</p>

<p>The video was made so it would be easy to add subtitles together with Japanese subtitles, however, the client said they wanted for the subtitles too be attached two and two.
Therefore all of the subtitles and the tables were changed.
Similar to the subtitles the tables had been made to have translations attached over them.
Files for subtitles and tables were all stored in PNG which were divided into sections which showed up on screen.
For future videos the borders  for these sections will be marked out during the edit phase.</p>
