<p>Wolfang's 2014 video "Colour My World" is a 3 minute long music video.
The video was releases together with a piano cover.
The story is about a man who search for a girl in the video's black and white world.</p>

<p>The original musical piece was written for the flash game of the same title by Silver Stitch.
Inspiration for style and story for the video was taken from the game.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the game was made in flash, the video was presented via live speed painting.
'Speed painting' is a style where a painting is made in a short time span.
However, if one do a quick search on any popular video-site it will seem as if the concept of speed painting is that of sped up videos of painting being made.
As for the presented video, the selected style adds movement, and it propel the story.
In order to emphasize the emotions in the video, in contrast to the characters simple black lines, flowers and hearts alike were painted with bright colors.</p>

<p>The video was taken with a GoPro action camera.
Consequently, the captured angle became wide and the picture got distorted.
The resulted fish eye effect was fixed in the post-process.
However, because the picture was cut it was difficult to know where the borders of the frame where while recording.</p>

<p>In the end the results were satisfying.
Although the paintings were not as beautiful as the visuals in the game the style presented the story well.</p>
