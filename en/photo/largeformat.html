<h1 style="text-align: center;">Large Format Photography</h1>

<section class="photoParagraph">
<p>Large format photography is a technique that involves multiple exposures with each one taken in a slightly different direction.
A regular photo is taken onto a 35 mm sensor, but when the sensor is moved it will cover more area beyond 35 mm, which is why it's called "large frame."
The most popular use of this technique is "panoramas" in which case the camera is panned sideways.
The horizontal and vertical movement result in enormous photos.
One photo takes around 30 minutes to take and a tripod is necessary.</p>

<a class="largePhotoTitle" href="https://a.l3n.co/i/VDPMD3.jpeg">Inner Shrine Grounds</a>
<p>The camera was placed in depths of the premises with the lens facing North to which the sunlight reflected warmth in the background.
The area is surrounded by forest, and the right side of the picture consists of bright shrines.
Above and beyond the vermilion shrine gates branches blew with the wind.
In contrast, the left side consists of one dimly lit shrine placed in the shadow.
From the perspective the left shrine is cut off vertically by two pines.
It's so dark that at a quick glance only the red cloth of the foxes will be caught by the eye.
However, the bright green leaves of the left background separate out the dark and create strong contrast.
Right in between the right part and the left part is a road.
The road leads the eye to the bright parts of the area which the viewer will have to image themselves as it's concealed by the foreground.</p>

<a class="largePhotoTitle" href="https://c.l3n.co/i/VDPoW0.jpeg">Ishimiya</a>
<p>At the front of the shrine, subordinate shrines were lined up.
The sub-shrine that was picked as a subject had "Ishimiya" written on it.
In the middle were 3 small shrine gates neatly placed, and on each side fox statues stood.
Moss grew on both the rocks and the foxes to which the right fox' face was covered in moss.
The shrine pillars created a frame for the scenery, and the vermilion and red colors together with the deep green moss created a wonderful combination on top of the stone texture.</p>

<a class="largePhotoTitle" href="https://b.l3n.co/i/VDPuVD.jpeg">Divine stones</a>
<p>In the middle of the shrine there were a few small divine stones.
The stones were covered in moss to the extent that the front was hard to read.
There was some cracked porcelain in front and spiders had left spiderwebs in the moss below.</p>

<a class="largePhotoTitle" href="https://b.l3n.co/i/V7EAAo.jpeg">Cross tombstone</a>
<p>The first time the tombstone entered the viewfinder there were three snails stuck near the top.
The combination of snails that had climbed up and lichen made it stand out which is why this scenery was chosen.
A lap around to the back and a squat revealed a perspective where the mostly overlooked tombstones lined up with the view and the background backlight filled the frame and made the dim area appear bright.
The foreground consists of gray tombstones and a monotone tree matched with green grass and lush moss.
The ground is sparsely scattered with red and brown leaves.
The red leaves in the background were faded out by the backlight which helped to move focus on the subject.
Furthermore the black bus stop in the background was also faded by the backlight.
There is a willow tree on the left side that shoots up and out of frame, and its leaves then appear dangling down on the left side with a swaying motion from the wind.
There are three tombstones in the picture.
The tombstone next to the tree looks like a trunk which makes it hard to spot.</p>

<a class="largePhotoTitle" href="https://a.l3n.co/i/V7EWV9.jpeg">Large oak tree</a>
<p>After one has passed through the dim vegetated parts and entered the spacious parts of the graveyard, one could hear the wind rustle from above.
If one turned their head upwards the view would reveal a large oak tree that filled the field of view with leaves moving with the wind.
The top of the oak's strong branches were covered in moss and the low sun reflected the trees bark in a golden glow which created contrast between the upper parts of the branches and the lower parts.
Since this view could be gazed upon for a long time it was chosen for a large format photo.</p>

<a class="largePhotoTitle" href="https://c.l3n.co/i/V7TTe1.jpeg">Tree lined road</a>
<p>And finally.
In the south end of the graveyard is a tree lined road.
The golden evening light accented the colors of the leaves beautifully.
The leaves that had blown up on the road made it feel like autumn.
Flies illuminated in the light and a blackbird sang behind the photographer as the camera was placed at the end of the road and the large format photo was taken.
The result is an immensely large photo.
The lined trees were reminiscent of street lights as the crown appeared to glow.
From there the autumn exploration was set to an end and the photo album was concluded.</p>
