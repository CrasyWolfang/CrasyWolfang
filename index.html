<center><h1>Image server down!</h1>
2021-06-27</center>

<p>

Due to problems with censorship photo and image uploads where moved to another image server called <i>FunkyIMG</i>.
However, the server went down in June and it was announced on <a href="https://forum.funkysouls.org/p/10452846">the official forum</a> that the service would be discontinued.
Accordingly they have had problems with unlawful images on the site.
Now photos on posts from February, March and June are unavailable and the search for another server is underway.
</p>

<p>

As for now software related to language acquisition is under development.
The software will soon enter it's alpha phase meaning that a selected group of people will be able to try it out.
There are plans to change the layout of the website once the software has reached it's alpha stage.
</p>

<p>

Unfortunately due to problems with the image server these photos cannot be displayed at the moment.

<center><h1>Kyoto Autumn</h1>
Seasonal photography, 2021-02-21</center><!--</a>-->

<p>

Last year's autumn, photos for the website was taken.
These photos were taken on three different occasions and circulate around the autumn.
Besides Umekoji Park and the mountain situated behind Ryoan Temple these photos were taken in various parks in Kyoto.
</p>

<p>

Although these are autumn photos, by the time they were posted winter had already ended and spring was on it's way.
These is due to how time is currently distributed.
However, from spring and forward more time will be given for the website which will most likely increase the number of posts.

<center><h1>Last Year</h1>
2021-02-02</center>

<p>

It's the year 2021.
It's already been a year since this website was released.
In that time various photos and movie clips has been shared through posts.
</p>

<p>

Year 2020 the novel corona virus spread across the world.
The resulting pandemic continues even into 2021.
Compared to other countries Japan has been safe, however the inhabitants of Japan has certainly felt the impact.
The virus has indirectly impacted the website as well.
As a result of the effects portray photography and photography trips has been canceled, plans for interviews has been cut short, and posts has been delayed.
</p>

<p>

In connection, 2020 was the first year for the website.
Therefore the content and the style of the website had yet not been settled.
During that year it became clear what changes were needed and that the website should be updated within the near future.
Among the updates are plans to remove the right pane, and to add description and links to photos.
Furthermore, from now on updates for the weblog will be written with more clarity.
</p>

<p>

In relation to this year, remaining posts created last year will be released.
Previously computer programming related posts were planned to be released, however it's unknown if they will be released this year.
From spring and forward focus on photography including video will be increased and the cooperation with Osaka International House will be continued.
It's left to see by then what will be posted.
