<p>

"The Cosmopolis" is a 2020 concert.
Since the performers are from all across the world it was given that name.
</p>

<p>

At the start the concert consisted of a few songs.
However, as time went on other performers caught interest and joined.
In the end the concert came to consist of 21 songs over the span of 2 hours.
</p>

<h2>Preparations</h2>

<p>

In order to prepare practice sessions of the performances where watched.
While they were watched camera angles and such was considered.
However, since the lack of time there were some performances where no training sessions were watched.
On top of that there were some instances where additional songs were added one day prior to the concert.
</p>

<p>

One more camera was borrowed.
This camera became the center camera.
However, there was not enough time to get used to this added camera besides the necessary controls.
</p>

<h2>Recording</h2>

<p>

On the day of recording 4 cameras where brought with a total of 2 camera operators.
All of the camras were in use from start to end.
One of the problems at hand was that the second camera operator was not used to how to handle a DSLR.
Therefore the focus from the left camera missed the object a lot of the time.
</p>

<p>

A major problem was failed captures.
The camera in the middle was places to avoid dropped footage.
However, the central camera also dropped some footage.
Consequently there were a few seconds where there was no footage taken at all.
Besides those few seconds everything was captured from at least some angle.
</p>

<h2>Post-process</h2>

<p>

The post process took a lot of time.
Adobe Elements was used.
However, Adobe Elements does not allow for edits across multiple clips at the same time.
Therefore it was not possible to apply a basic edit across multiple clips.
On top of that, not only was the color balance different between the different cameras. The color balance in the room was not even and the auto balance was turned on.
Because of that every cut was corrected individually.
</p>

<p>

The performances varied.
Therefor the edit was matched to the performance.
The edit for calm songs made use dissolve transaction.
On the other side the spectrum, for lively songs camera movements and shakes were kept.
</p>
