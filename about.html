<h2>About</h2>

<h2>Weblog</h2>

<p>

Although it is called a weblog, it's not the typical kind of blog that has made it into the modern use.
Instead the content of the weblog relates to changes, releases and updates related on the website.
</p>

<h2>Photography</h2>

<p>

The photos on the website are of everything from nature to city landscape. 
The text in posts for photography has been kept low so that the viewer can take their time to look at the photos and enjoy the content.
The themes of the photographs range from the feeling and look of place and the beauty of the seasons to portraits of individual people.
Both still photos and moving images are used.
